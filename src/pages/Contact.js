            <p>If you'd like me to try out a favorite dessert of yours to potentially add to the list, I'd be happy for you to contact me. If you wish use my number, please refrain from calling, but text instead, unless necessary. Otherwise, email me! Be sure to send links or complete, detailed descriptions for recipes, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Also, PLEASE do not spam or advertise with my contact. I will block you, and you're only making my life more difficult, so I would ask you kindly not to do either of those.</p>
